        <p>
            As a <abbr title="Sympli is a tiny (headcount-wise) company so there are no formal titles or anything. Still, someone has to play certain roles here, and thinking about the product is one of those I do.">product owner</abbr> of <a href="https://sympli.io/versions" target="_blank">Sympli Versions</a> and macOS engineering lead, I've got to wear a lot of them hats:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b title="/me sous-chef-ing the roadmap">üë®‚Äçüç≥ Product.</b> Helping the team shape a product vision, I‚Äôm drafting feature proposals and driving them across the board, iterating on feedback and adjusting ideas to business needs. I‚Äôve managed to compose a few high-level roadmaps and some more detailed action plans for specific feature trees along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b title="/me getting the team ready to take off">üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Team.</b> At times, it‚Äôs my responsibility to convey technical requirements for backend, desktop, QA, and marketing teams; coordinate their workload and adjust the scope of work to meet deadlines. I‚Äôve also hired, interviewed, and onboarded a few teammates.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b title="/me looking for clues in logs and crash reports">üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Customers.</b> I‚Äôm often the first responder for customer support requests, a technical writer, and an author of various marketing materials. So there're daily Intercom, emails, log files, and crash reports to go through.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b title="/me growing and trimming the codebase">üë®‚Äçüåæ Tech.</b> Here my focus is on building a robust native macOS app that has to orchestrate user documents, branching, git-level storage and transport layers, semantic Sketch document versioning and diffing, design reviews and discussions, and UI-driven conflict resolution flow involving cross-dependent design components. All of that with Swift, some <abbr title="Please don't make me write C++. I still have PTSD from all the boilerplate required to put an object into std::set">C++</abbr>, NSOperations, <abbr title="We actually use it as an object graph and a single source of truth for our data that comes from at least 5 different origins: the app itself, Sketch, git, Finder, and the backend">Core Data</abbr>, libgit2, and AppKit.

        <p>
            I‚Äôm also responsible for the desktop side of <a href="https://sympli.io/handoff" target="_blank">Sympli Handoff</a> where most of my effort goes into a non-trivial native <a href="https://github.com/sympli/sympli-sketch-plugin" target="_blank">Sketch plugin</a> that manipulates internal Sketch data model directly bypassing limited official APIs and sports a&nbsp;standalone AppKit UI flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite part of this project is an extensive automated test suite that validates private API contracts and specific document layout cases against <abbr title="Every single one of them starting from 46.2 and up to the latest Beta, to be exact.">multiple</abbr> versions of Sketch during a CI run. All checks are performed dynamically inside Sketch via code injection and a bit of Objective-C metaprogramming. There‚Äôs also image snapshot testing for tricky setups that would be a nuisance to validate otherwise.

            I was in charge of Batch Processing feature in <a href="https://imageframer.net/articles/whats-new-in-imageframer-4-0/" target="_blank">ImageFramer</a>: adapted an existing single-threaded image processing engine to work in a multi-threaded environment required for parallel application of image templates; built a UI flow for the highly-configurable batch export process.

            Also made a few smaller contributions to <a href="https://blog.apparentsoft.com/trickster/1378/trickster-brings-a-light-theme/" target="_blank">Trickster</a>: introduced a light theme (and theming support in general); updated the way file previews work there; made Watched Folders play nicely with macOS Sandbox.
