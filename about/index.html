            My main area of expertise is macOS development, but Iâ€™ve always been a generalist who is comfortable working with a diverse set of technologies in various domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy high-level product discussions and user research as well as prototyping, shaping technical solutions, reverse-engineering, and writing code.

        <p class="employment-info"><a href="https://sympli.io/versions" target="_blank">Sympli Versions</a> â€ , 2017 â€“ 2025</p>
        <p>
            As a <abbr title="Sympli was tiny headcount-wise, so there were no formal titles or anything. Still, someone had to play certain roles here, and thinking about the product is one of those that I did."><b>product owner</b></abbr>, I was drafting product proposals and driving them across the board, iterating and adjusting ideas to feedback. I managed to compose a few high-level roadmaps and some more detailed action plans for specific feature trees along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an occasional <b>team lead</b>, I was conveying technical requirements for backend, desktop, QA, and marketing teams; coordinating their workload and adjusting the scope of work to meet deadlines. I also hired and onboarded a few teammates.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a first responder for <b>customer support</b> requests, a <b>technical writer</b>, and an author of various <b>marketing</b> materials, I had daily Intercom chats, Stripe dashboards, email threads, logs, and crash reports to investigate and respond to.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also involved in writing <b>pitch decks</b> for potential partners and investors, highlighting both our products and our team. A few of those pitches I ended up delivering myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I was leading the development of a <b>native macOS</b> app that put together Sketch document branching, semantic versioning, diffing and merging, design reviews and discussions.
            Built with Swift, AppKit, <abbr title="We built a standalone C++ cross-platform (macOS, Linux, and even Windows in theory) command line tool incorporating all business logic of diffing and merging Sketch documents (which are, in a nutshell, large interconnected JSON trees). This tool would be run both on a client side by Versions.app, and on our backend by a worker service.">C++</abbr>, NSOperations, <abbr title="We *do* actually use it as an object graph and a single source of truth for our data that comes from at least 5 different origins: the app itself, Sketch, git, Finder, and our own backend">Core Data</abbr>, and libgit2.

        <p>
            I was responsible for the integrations side of <a href="https://sympli.io/handoff" target="_blank">Sympli Handoff</a> where most of my effort went into a <a href="https://github.com/sympli/sympli-sketch-plugin" target="_blank">Sketch plugin</a> that manipulates reverse-engineered Sketch data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite part of this project is an extensive automated test suite that validates private API contracts and specific document layout cases against <abbr title="Every single one of them starting from 46.2 and up to the latest Beta, to be exact.">multiple</abbr> versions of Sketch during a CI run. All checks are performed dynamically inside Sketch via code injection and a bit of Objective-C metaprogramming. Thereâ€™s also image snapshot testing for tricky setups that would be a nuisance to validate otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of that, I was maintaining plugins for Figma, Xcode, Adobe XD and Photoshop.
